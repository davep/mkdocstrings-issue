# MkDocs/MkDocStrings case test

Noticed that Textual's docs won't include class attributes that have the
same name but different case (see `TITLE` vs `title`). This is an isolated
repository to test the core documentation pipeline tools to see if I can
identify the reason why.

*SPOILER:* In isolation I can't recreate the problem.
